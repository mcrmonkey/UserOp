"UserOP"


This is a script intended to make basic user administration on a samba easier.


Firstly...
	I Apologies for my coding. I know it isnt even close to "good"


The script:
	The script is basically a wrapper for "useradd" "passwd" and "smbpasswd".
	it is intended to make the addition, removal and changes of user passwords "simple".
	The script is written for use with bash

	


Its beginnings:
	The script
		was written to make it easy for someone who doesn't know linux to add, remove and edit user account details on a linux server with a simple default samba installation.
		was designed for a Debian based distro of linux, but it should be easy enough adjust for other linux distrobutions. i've attempted to make the script easier to change by adding a few default values to the top of the script.


What it does in a bit more detail:
	If invoked with "add" it will first add the user to the linux system, then add the user to a 'default' group then add the user to the samba password database
	if invoked with "del" it will delete the user account from the samba user database then remove the user from the system. The users home directory will not be deleted however.
	if invoked with "pass" the script will modify both the system and samba passwords. As the script was put together in a bit of a rush it will ask the person running the script for the new password 4 times ( new password, verify password )
